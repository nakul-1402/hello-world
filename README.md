So basically I am a Mechanical engineering undergrad & i am extremely, like too much on the extreme side, interested in ML, AI and Automation. 
using all my skills, at some point in my life, i will create a breakthrough move that will change the world.
Also, I am going to be very rich, like filthy rich.
